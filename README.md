# 🧾 Salary Data Analysis – Case Study

This project dives into a real-world dataset of employee salary records, helping uncover trends, clean messy data, and visualize insights.

## 📂 Dataset Overview:
The dataset (`Salaries.csv`) includes:
- Employee names and job titles
- Base pay, overtime pay, and benefits
- Total compensation (with and without benefits)
- Year of employment record

## ❓ Questions Explored:
- What is the average base pay of an accountant?
- How many unique job titles are there?
- What are the most common job titles?
- Which titles were held by only one person in a given year?
- What jobs are most popular among high earners?
- How does the length of job titles change over time?
- Is there any correlation between compensation types?

## 🧹 What I did:
- Cleaned the dataset (handled nulls, fixed dtypes)
- Filtered outliers and invalid data
- Explored trends using Pandas queries
- Created visualizations using Seaborn & Matplotlib

## 📊 Key Insights:
- Found job titles with highest and lowest average pay
- Discovered common roles and rare job titles
- Compared compensation across years and roles
- Highlighted correlation (or lack thereof) between different salary components

## 🛠️ Tools Used:
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Pandas for data wrangling

## 💡 Why this project?
This analysis helped me practice real-life data cleaning, query writing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA). It shows how even a simple dataset can reveal powerful insights when approached with the right questions.
